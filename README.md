* Business feature #1 - Owner of a building will be able to to post listings(places for rent and/or for sale) on the app, delete old listings, update information on the places and perform read operation.
* Buisness feature #2 - Owner is able to manage tenants. can add new tenants, delete old tenants, update tenant information,and perform read operation on the current tenants.
* The problem we are trying to solve is removing third party involvement such as brokers. This prevents the property owner and potential tenant from paying extra payment.
