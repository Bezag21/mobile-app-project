# mobile-app-project
# Property management system
* This project will be about building a system in which a property owner will be able to manage his building using the app.
 * For this project we are focusing on the management of a single building. When there are free spaces(for businesses) and apartments, the owner can post about it on the app. Users can signup to view the listings and the admin can manage the tenants.
* The problem we are trying to solve is removing third party involvement such as brokers. This prevents the property owner and potential tenant from paying extra payment.
