This is a Dart class named `ConfirmPassword` which extends the `Equatable` class. The `Equatable` class is used to simplify the process of comparing objects for equality by generating `==` and `hashCode` methods based on the object's properties.

The `ConfirmPassword` class has two nullable string properties: `confirmPassword` and `password`. The constructor takes these two properties as parameters using named parameters.

Inside the constructor, it checks if the `confirmPassword` property is less than 8 characters and throws an exception if it is. It also checks if `confirmPassword` is not equal to `password` and throws an exception if they are not equal.

The `toString()` method returns the `confirmPassword` string.

The `props` method is required by the `Equatable` class and returns a list of properties to be used for equality comparison. In this case, it only includes the `confirmPassword` property.
